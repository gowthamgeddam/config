# config

Just some config files, so that I can set all my preferences whenever I create a new [VM](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=virtualmachine).

I'm trying to use [Arch BTW](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ArchBTW).

But till now, all my "working" VMs were debain-based <!--I've used Ubuntu, Kali Linux, Linux Mint-->, so used `apt` in the scripts.
